# Learning-Unity

This repository is used as a learning ground for testing and studying all that Unity has to Offer.
It was primarily created by following the Unity Basics course section of the Complete C# Masterclass course in Udemy.
This repository will be used to hold this unity testing project used to familiarize myself with the Unity environment.
It will grow as my knowledge base grows.
